The developed code follows the general principles from your initial project documents, 
but it requires more alignment to fit with the specific requirements in the diagrams and 
specifications:

    Sequence and Use Case Diagrams:

        - The code reflects the basic workflow from the Eagle Deployment Sequence Diagram: it allows 
          a user to initiate commands, checks for necessary parameters, and processes commands from 
          a playbook.yaml file. The -e and -l options allow task execution and YAML file listing, 
          similar to initiating tasks and managing inventories in the diagram.

        - The Eagle Deployment Use Case Diagram mentions components like inventory, modules, and plugins. 
          Currently, we only handle playbooks and hosts. Adding modules and plugins could align the tool 
          more with the diagram's vision, allowing for specialized tasks or extensions.

    Preliminary Design Specification:

        - The design document outlines a goal of building a tool that is both scalable and performant, 
          similar to Ansible but optimized for concurrency (Go’s main advantage over Python). While our 
          tool currently runs locally, adding concurrency for parallel host connections would bring it 
          closer to the specification.

        - The document mentions using a stateful and stateless approach. The current implementation is 
          essentially stateless, as it doesn’t persist state across runs. Adding a stateful component, 
          perhaps with task tracking or rollback capabilities, would align more closely with the goals outlined.

    State Diagram (Replace Ansible State Diagram):

        - The Replace Ansible State Diagram suggests both StatefulEagleDeployment and StatelessEagleDeployment 
          classes. The current implementation is more like StatelessEagleDeployment, with no persistent state 
          between executions.

        - We could introduce a state-tracking feature that records task completion and errors, which would 
          allow for resuming or rolling back on failures. This could be done by writing to a log or database 
          (e.g., SQLite) to track state across runs.

    Class Diagram (State Diagram Cap):

        - The Class Diagram (State Diagram Cap) outlines a command framework with error handling, command 
          parsing, and output display. The current code partially aligns with this, using basic error handling 
          and output for each task.

        - To better match this structure, we could refactor the code into distinct classes or modules: 
          CommandParser, ExecuteCommand, ErrorHandling, etc. This would enhance modularity and follow the 
          diagram’s structure more closely.

Next Steps to Improve Alignment:

    Concurrency:

        - Implement concurrent task execution across hosts. Go’s goroutines would allow us to deploy 
          tasks in parallel, improving scalability.

    State Management:

        - Introduce a stateful tracking system (e.g., SQLite) to record task status and allow for rollback 
          or retry in future executions.

    Class-based Refactoring:

        - Refactor the tool into components resembling CommandParser, ExecuteCommand, and ErrorHandling. 
          This would give the structure more modularity, allowing future expansion for additional commands 
          and error-handling strategies.

    Plugins and Modules:

        - Implement a plugin system that lets users extend functionality by adding custom modules. This 
          could allow for tailored tasks like package installation, service management, or monitoring as 
          outlined in the use case diagram.
